# Dolmenwood
This is a Foundry VTT game system implementing the Dolmenwood ruleset.

The system is still in development, but most major features are already implemented and automated. Please be aware that most of the actual content (items, monsters, spells) is not available at the moment, and will be provided in a separate module in the near future. You can however add your own custom items and try out the system in its current (Early Access) state.

Simply use this manifest URL to install it: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NecroticGnome/dolmenwood-foundry-system/main/system.json
